# Python-Learning-Programs
Simple python programs used to learn the language.
As of right now I believe the only one that doesn't work is the flash card program. It used to be a program that would take
a simple text file that was organized in a certain way to produce the questions and answers for flash cards.
This program would help me with many of my college exams so far. Sadly a few moments ago while importing all my programs to
GitHub I accidentally deleted the program and all the working text files with different sets of flash cards. I hope to
rebuild this program now but even better because this definitely helped increase my tests grades.
